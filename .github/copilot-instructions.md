# React Fibers & Server Components POC

This project is a Proof of Concept for studying React Fibers architecture and React Server Components.

## Project Focus Areas

- React Fibers: Understanding concurrent rendering, priority queues, and work scheduling
- React Server Components: Server-side rendering, streaming, and performance optimization
- Performance analysis and comparison between different rendering approaches
- Practical examples demonstrating the differences between legacy and fiber-based rendering

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Understand how React Fibers work internally
2. Explore React Server Components and their benefits
3. Compare performance between different rendering strategies
4. Implement practical examples showing concurrent features
5. Analyze the impact of different rendering approaches on user experience

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for better type safety and development experience
- Focus on practical, demonstrable examples
- Include performance measurement tools
- Document findings and observations
- Create interactive examples to visualize concepts
